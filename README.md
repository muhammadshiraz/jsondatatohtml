## Convert JSON to HTML using JavaScript

Given an PHP document containing JSON data and the task is to convert JSON data into a HTML table.

Approach:

Take the JSON Object in a variable.
Call a function which first adds the column names to the < table > element.(It is looking for the all columns, which is UNION of the column names).
Traverse the JSON data and match key with the column name. Put the value of that key in the respective column.
Leave the column empty if there is no value of that key.

This code below is an improvement to my ad-hoc JavaScript solution I created a few weeks ago for a ASP.NET project, link below. As you will see below, itâ€™s pretty easy to render a HTML table from a object array using plain JavaScript. Since most results are in a Table or Detail layout, I created 1 functions to return the data in either format. I also added some optional parameters that you can set to control formatting. The Details View was designed to show a single row/object, the headers will display on the left and the data will display on the right (see snapshot).
